title: Hi, I'm Joseph Low ðŸ‘‹

I used to be good at introductions. Lately, it's been harder. The usual labels donâ€™t quite fit.

One Iâ€™ve been trying on is community gardener. Not manicured, soulless gardens, but ones full of life and surprises. I like to imagine you and I planting seeds in physical and digital spaces that might grow into meaningful, lasting communities.

Iâ€™ve been gardening my whole life, but recently learnt some of the seeds I planted were actually weeds. Even now, Iâ€™m not sure if the ones Iâ€™m planting will be welcomed or pulled out. Still, I keep planting because maybe something unexpected will take root.

This site is where I share what Iâ€™m growing. If you're curious about anything or found something meaningful, feel free to contact me on telegram [@jolow](https://telegram.me/jolow).
